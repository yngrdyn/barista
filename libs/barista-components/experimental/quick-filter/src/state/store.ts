/**
 * The Quick Filter Store is one place where the state is handled.
 * It is a minimal implementation of a redux like architecture to handle
 * state in an immutable and on-directional way.
 *
 * This makes testing and debugging way easier, because there is always a
 * clear state that can only be modified through actions.
 *
 * 1. Action gets dispatched (An action indicates a change in the store)
 * 2. The reducer gets an action and the current state, and according to the action
 *    modifies the state.
 * 3. A Selector can always read the latest value from the store and displays it in
 *    a template. So the only way to modify the state is dispatching an action.
 * 4. If some async work has to be done the effect is responsible for that.
 *    Effects are listening for actions then doing some async work and dispatching some
 *    Other actions with the payload of the async stuff.
