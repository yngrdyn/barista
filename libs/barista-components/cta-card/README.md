# Cta Card

**DEPRECATED â€“ will be removed with version 6.0.0** Please use
`<dt-empty-state>` in combination with `<dt-card>` instead. See the
[empty state](/components/empty-state) and the [card](/components/card) for more
details.

The `<dt-cta-card>` is a specific type of card showing a call to action content,
defined by a title, an image, a teaser text and an action button. In addition to
the custom content, the cta card can hold some special sections:

- `<dt-cta-card-title>` - The title of the cta card
- `<dt-cta-card-image>` - Image to be shown within the illustration region of
  the cta card
- `<dt-cta-card-footer-actions>` - Action buttons, displayed below the text. For
  the regular cases there should only be one primary cta styled dt-button.
- `<dt-cta-card-title-actions>` - Buttons displayed next to the title. Should be
  a secondary styled dt-button showing an image.

## Imports

You have to import the `DtCtaCardModule` when you want to use the `dt-cta-card`:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [DtCtaCardModule],
})
class MyModule {}
```

Please note that you should not use the cta-card's elements like title to hold
any arbitrary content just for spacing purposes, make sure to put only the cards
title inside the `<dt-cta-card-title>` element and not controls like buttons.
