# Viewport resizer

The `ViewportResizer` is an abstract class that specifies a `change` function
that returns a stream that fires every time a window resize event is triggered
or `emit` is called. The Angular components library provides a
`DefaultViewportResizer` implementing `ViewportResizer` and a provider
`DEFAULT_VIEWPORT_RESIZER_PROVIDER` to use within the application. The
`DEFAULT_VIEWPORT_RESIZER_PROVIDER` ensures that there is only one instance of
the `ViewportResizer` implementation.

## Dependencies

The `ViewportResizer` depends on`ViewportRuler` from `@angular/cdk/scrolling'`
and `Platform` from `'@angular/cdk/platform'`
