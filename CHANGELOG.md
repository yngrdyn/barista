Most of the breaking changes will be fixed automatically by running
`ng update @dynatrace/barista-components`. Some required changes like highcharts
type changes require context and therefore cannot be automated. See our
[migration guide](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/barista/blob/master/documentation/migration-guide.md)
for further information on how to migrate.

  \_viewportRuler, \_platform and \_overlayContainer mandatory in the

  define the structure of the passed data. The filter-fields default data-source
  no longer takes a generic, as the structure of the data is already defined
  there. The node definitions now take optional generics for the consumer to
  specify the structure of the data.

### Experimental Package ⚠️

Components from the experimental package have to be imported via
`@dynatrace/barista-components/experimental/...`. Those components are not meant
to be used on production.

The experimental package does not follow semantic versioning like the rest of
the library does.

This means that we might break the api in every version. It is only meant to be
used for testing and feedback purpose!

## 6.0.0 (2020-03-02)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Update to Angular 9** requires us to update our `peerDependencies`.
  Furthermore, our applications are compiled with Ivy. Only the component
  library is compiled with the view-engine to be backwards compatible.
- Core platform utils changed to be internal.
- Components that are using the outdated Renderer2, which is removed in this
  commit, do this by injecting it via DI in their constructor. Removing the
  renderer constructor parameter is considered a breaking api change.
- Improved `DtChartOptions` for the highcharts typings.
- The `readKeyCode` function from the core package is now internal, because the
  [`KeyboardEvent.keyCode` is deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode).
- The method `getDtChartColorPalette` and constants
  `DT_CHART_COLOR_PALETTE_ORDERED`, `DT_CHART_COLOR_PALETTES` were moved to the
  `@dynatrace/barista-components/theming` package.

### Bug Fixes

- **schematics:** Fixes an issue in the ng-add schematic.
